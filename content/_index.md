##### I write about how human beings get on in the world — how we form relationships with other living things, how our bodies are shaped by where we live and what we do.

I give special attention to the question of scale — how the intimate (eating, sleeping, moving, sensing) relates to the global (social acceleration, climate change), how the deep past relates to the imminent future.

In my empirical life I design new methods of observing social behavior in the wild. These tend to involve participatory distributed sensing.

## Deep social phenomics

Most of what is distinctively human in human behavior is social in nature, that is,
it unfolds in the coordinate action of two or more individuals (think of language and music).
But social scientists of all stripes have long struggled with the question of how
to measure social behavior "in the wild."

In some circles, talk of rigorous measurement provokes alarm.
For those who prioritize experience over outward signs of behavior, any effort to
reduce the dimensionality of experience in analysis can seem like an act of violence,
in particular toward those whose experience has been characterized as deviant.

But, in fact, done with sensitivity, rigorous measurement represents a critical tool of advocacy on behalf of the marginalized.

Take psychosis. Over the past ten years, as efforts to identify the neurophysiological, epigenetic, and genetic determinants of psychosis have crystallized, it has become clear that these measures are often of limited value in the absence of detailed behavioral, phenomenological, and environmental data—what has come to be known as a *deep phenotype*.

Generally, efforts to elicit deep phenotypes rely on established techniques of anamnesis and physical diagnosis—semi-structured interviews, batteries, neurological exams, collation of education and hospitalization records, and sometimes collection of endocrine factors. These exclude some of the potentially most significant dimensions of behavior, phenomenology, and environment, to wit, those that unfold in how the individual experiences the world on a day-to-day basis *in the wild* — circadian rhythms of social contact, ambient light and sound exposure, and transient peaks and troughs in mood, motor vigilance, other-directedness, social anxiety, and trust and mistrust.

So the question is: *How might we observe these things?* What we need is a new genre of behavioral–phenomenological–environmental measure, using high-resolution remote sensing to evoke study participants’ subjective states of being and perisomatic environment in real time. This I call *deep social phenomics.*

Deep social phenomics combines validated methods of experience sampling with state-of-the-art techniques of signals processing, including the use of convolutional neural networks for the automated extraction of socially salient high-level environmental features from panoramic image data collected *by the participants* as they go about their daily lives. It leverages recent advances in cloud-based microservice architecture and digital optics that have made it possible to involve participants directly and actively in the production of data — and sometimes in the design of research questions — while keeping the protocol noninvasive and even fun.

The question of how to evoke a deep social phenotype in the field while staying
critically engaged with the difficulties of representing behavior in a way that is
concise, expressive, and politically reflexive all at the same time
has been an abiding theme of my research since 2013. This question stands at the heart
of my 2015 book, *Computable Bodies*, not to say my concurrent work at the Wellcome-funded
research initiative Hubbub and new projects since — more to come.

## Meat

Humanity is eating more meat. Over the next thirty years, demand for meat is projected to grow at twice the rate of demand for plant-based foods. This means a huge commitment of resources. Meat-eating has become an enormous stress on the biosphere — and, to a growing number of people, a cause of immense injustice. And yet, conventional wisdom holds that meat made us what we are — that much of what makes us human, from big brains and slow life history to planning, social coordination, fine motor control, and our unique form of bipedal locomotion, arose in response to an innate craving for meat. So in a world of rising incomes, growing demand for meat is inevitable.

In my forthcoming book *Meat*, I argue that we have the relationship between biology and capitalism backward. *Meat* considers the full sweep of meat’s history, from the first appearances of proto-human hominins nearly three million years ago to the global trade in livestock products today. I argue that not only did meat not make us human, contemporary growth in demand for meat is driven as much by economic uncertainty as by affluence.

Before we conclude that the human future is carnivorous, we need a public conversation about meat-eating that gets beyond Paleolithic diets and animal protection to address the deeply entwined economic and political lives of humans and animals past, present, and future. *Meat* offers a starting point for this conversation.

## Bio

From 2013 to 2017 I was visiting researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences.

From 2014 to 2016 I led the Remote Sensing of Mood strand of the Wellcome-funded research initiative Hubbub.

From 2013 to 2014 I was scientist/artist-in-residence at LUST and LUSTlab (now [RNDR](https://rndr.studio)) in The Hague.

Prior to that I was a Carson Fellow at the Rachel Carson Center for Environment and Society in Munich,
a postdoctoral research fellow at the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science in Berlin,
a postdoctoral fellow at the Institute for the Human Sciences, Vienna,
and a lecturer in the Health and Societies Program at the University of Pennsylvania.
