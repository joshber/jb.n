I write about about how human beings form relationships with other living things and how our bodies are shaped by where we live and what we do.

I give special attention to the question of scale â€” how the intimate (eating, sleeping, moving, sensing) relates to the global (social acceleration, climate change), how the deep past relates to the imminent future.

**New.** From August 2018 I will be a USC Berggruen Fellow at the Berggruen Institute in Los Angeles.
