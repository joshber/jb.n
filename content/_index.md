# Josh Berson

Essayist, novelist, bothy enthusiast. Author of Computable Bodies (2015), The Meat Question (2019), and Ditch Kit (2020). My background is in computing, linguistics (the anthropological kind — indexicality, register formation), and the history of science. Some of what I do could be called philosophy of mind, but my remit is broader. It includes questions of values — e.g., what distinguishes flourishing from survival? One recurring theme for me is the coupling of the intimate (eating, sleeping, being in pain) and the evolutionary (sentience, capitalism, niche exhaustion). Current preoccupations include the metaphysics of tinnitus and how category theory might enhance our thinking about social phenomena.

Occasionally I do things with [procedural sound](https://github.com/joshber/sndspc).

In 2018–19 I am a USC Berggruen Fellow at the Berggruen Institute in Los Angeles. From 2013 through 2017 I was visiting researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences.
