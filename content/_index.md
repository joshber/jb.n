<h1 class="fadein">Josh Berson</h1>

<p class="fadein delay1">I write about how human beings form relationships with other living things and how our bodies are shaped by where we live and what we do.</p>

<p class="fadein delay2">I give special attention to scale â€” how the intimate (eating, sleeping, moving, sensing) relates to the global (social acceleration, climate change), the deep past to the imminent future.</p>

<p class="fadein delay3"><a href=mailto:josh@joshberson.net">Write me</a>.</p>

<p class="fadein delay4"><strong>New.</strong> From August 2018 I will be a USC Berggruen Fellow at the Berggruen Institute in Los Angeles.</p>
