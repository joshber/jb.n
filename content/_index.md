# Josh Berson

I write about how living things become enmeshed in patterns of sensorikinetic coupling from the intimate (eating, sleeping, breathing, listening) to the planetary (social acceleration, climate change).

And I make [procedural sound](https://github.com/joshber/sndspc).

In 2018â€“19 I am a USC Berggruen Fellow at the Berggruen Institute in Los Angeles.
