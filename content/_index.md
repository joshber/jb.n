# Josh Berson

I write about how intimate behavior (eating, sleeping, photosynthesis, chemosignaling) gives rise to planetary phenomena (social acceleration, climate change).

Occasionally I make [procedural sound](https://www.dropbox.com/s/4raizlm9hrctda7/Berson%20Manifold.flac?dl=0)
([source](https://github.com/joshber/sndspc)).

In 2018–19 I am a USC Berggruen Fellow at the Berggruen Institute in Los Angeles.
