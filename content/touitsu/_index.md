# Contemplative Strategy

Markets are ever more volatile. The liberal order is disintegrating. Ice-free poles seem inevitable. No one knows what comes next. Nonetheless, you need to make a living.

I offer guidance in techniques of quiet attunement to support a focused, ethical way of conducting business, one that fosters an openness to all that we can neither anticipate nor control.

No branded process, just honest conversation backed up by my long experience learning how to listen and ask useful questions.
