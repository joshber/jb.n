# Autonomy

Today we are all expected to display infinite flexibility, pivoting at the whims of public manias over which we have no control. This is a stressful way to live. It imbues everyday life with a sense of being constantly off-balance. It contributes to the instrumentalization of relationships. And it’s inimical to the unforced experimentation that gives rise to a sense of purpose.

The path to autonomy runs through the undergrowth of late capitalism. I work with individuals struggling to clear the way. No questionnaires or checklists, just honest conversation backed up by my long experience learning how to listen and ask useful questions.
