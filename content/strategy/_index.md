# The Unbidden

Markets are ever more volatile. The liberal order is disintegrating. Ice-free poles seem inevitable. Nonetheless, you need to make a living.

I work with those seeking to clear a way â€” one that is focused, ethical, and attuned to the unbidden.

No branded process, just honest conversation backed up by my long experience learning how to listen.
