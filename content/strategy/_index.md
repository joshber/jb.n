# Contemplative Strategy

Markets are ever more volatile. The liberal order is disintegrating. Ice-free poles seem inevitable. Nonetheless, you need to make a living.

The path to contemplative strategy — focused, ethical, attuned to the unbidden — runs through the undergrowth of late capitalism. I work with those seeking to clear the way.

No branded process, just honest conversation backed up by my long experience learning how to listen and ask useful questions.
